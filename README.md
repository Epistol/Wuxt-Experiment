# WUXT = DO NOT USE

It doesn't work. Just, it works yes, but you can't dev on it : impossible to have any component to work, nobody knows why or how the execution cycle is broken and I don't have the strength to ressurect alone a project that didn't moved for 8 month for now.

## SOLUTION

The only solution I see is to do a classic Nuxt project and have it connected via wp rest api in a Dockerized instance. Somehow.
